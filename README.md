## Installation

### Via Composer

```bash
composer require componist/developer-bar
```

### Publish Configuration (Optional)

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Componist\DeveloperBar\DeveloperBarServiceProvider"
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0
- Laravel >= 8.0
- Livewire >= 2.0

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build Assets

```bash
# Build CSS and JS with Vite
npm run build
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

```

## Usage

The developer bar will automatically appear in your Laravel application when:

- Environment is set to `local` or `development`
- Response is HTML content
- Middleware is properly registered (automatically done by service provider)

### Manual Integration

If you need to manually include the developer bar in your views:

```blade
@livewire('componist-developer-bar')
```

## Configuration

The package automatically registers itself with Laravel. The service provider:

- Registers the Livewire component
- Adds middleware to the `web` middleware group
- Loads views from the package

### Environment Requirements

The developer bar only appears when:
- `APP_ENV=local` or `APP_ENV=development`
- Response content type is HTML

## Customization

### CSS Customization

Edit `resources/css/developer-bar.css` and run `npm run build` to rebuild.

### JavaScript Customization

Edit `resources/js/developer-bar.js` and run `npm run build` to rebuild.

### Livewire Component Customization

The main component is located at `src/Livewire/ComponistDeveloperBar.php`. You can extend or modify this component to add custom functionality.

### Blade Templates

Customize the appearance by modifying the Blade templates in `resources/views/`:
- `componist-developer-bar.blade.php` - Main component template
- `livewire/componist-developer-bar.blade.php` - Livewire component template

## Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build all assets with Vite
- `npm run dev` - Development mode with Vite
- `npm run watch` - Watch mode for development
- `npm run preview` - Preview built assets
- `npm run clean` - Remove built assets
